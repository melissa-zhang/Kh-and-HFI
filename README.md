These short programs were written in support of the article 
"Khovanov homology and involutive Heegaard Floer homology"
by Akram Alishahi, Linh Truong, and Melissa Zhang. 

Omega.py verifies that the explicit representative $\Omega$ of the homotopy equivalence between the Id bidmodule and the box-tensor of two Auroux-Zarev pieces described in Section 3.1 of the article.

merge.py and split.py verify that the $\Psi$ maps in Section 3.2 (for the merge and split cases, respectively) are indeed homomorphisms of CFA modules. Note that in the code for both, $\Psi$ is denoted by "h".
